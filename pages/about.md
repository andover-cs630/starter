# About

## Intro to our class:

Welcome to the [Phillips Academy](https://www.andover.edu/) Data Structures and Algorithms textbook! If you’re reading this now, it means you must be incredibly talented and in some way connected to Phillips Academy. This textbook was written by Dr. Nick Zufelt’s CS630 class - the highest level CS class at Andover. Enjoy!



## What’s on the website:
The website is our take on Data Structures and Algorithms. We’ve designed it to be accessible to anyone, whether you’ve just completed an AP Computer Science course or are an industry professional looking to brush up on some skills. To start, we’ve included a Foundations page with background information to bring you up to speed in case your coding has become a bit rusty (it happens to all of us). Next, the website is divided into different modules, each with an individual data structure or algorithm. Each page has been carefully peer reviewed by students. There, you’ll find an explanation of the data structure, an implementation, as well as practice questions and applications. Give us feedback at nzufelt@andover.edu.
